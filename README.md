- 👋 Hi, I’m @coffeebeans001 AKA oldDawgNewTricks001
- 👀 I’m interested in all things that are placed inside <....> I am an newbie, an excitied newbie. If I were a Crab fisher-person, I'd be called a Greenhorn. These are exciting times for me and I look forward to growth within the GitHub community. 
- 🌱 I’m about to start a Bootcamp coding course and it seems that I will learning a lot of new things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in the near future to be part of something bigger than myself.
- 📫 How to reach me ...You can reach me by railway, you can reach me by trailway. You can reach me on an aeroplane, you can reach me with your mind (It's possible). You can reach me by caravan, cross the desert like an Arab man. If all above fails marcel.maynard001@icloud.com
